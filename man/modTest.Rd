\title{Train a model and store \code{\linkS4class{ROCit}} tests on different datasets}
\usage{
modTest(method, datatype = c("train", "test"), traindata, testdata = NULL,
  modelKeep = FALSE, length = NULL, fitControl = NULL, metric = NULL,
  cores = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{method}{a a string specifying which classification
  or regression model to use. Possible values are found
  using \code{names(getModelInfo())}. See http://caret.r-
  forge.r-project.org/bytag.html. A list of funciotns can
  also be passed for a custom model function. See http://
  caret.r-forge.r-project.org/custom_models.html for details}
  \item{datatype}{a named character representing the accuracy
  object be built on either "train" or "test" data, user
  can include both} \item{traindata}{a list of length two
  containing a named slot for the matrix of predictors
  (pred) and the vector of classes (class)} \item{testdata}
  {a list of length two containing a named slot for the matrix
  of predictors (pred) and the vector of classes (class)}
  \item{modelKeep}{a logical indicating whether the original
  model object should be stored} \item{length}{an integer
  denoting the number of levels of each tuning parameter that
  should be generated to be passed to \code{tuneLength} in the
  \code{train} call} \item{fitControl}{an object generated by
  \code{trainControl} to control the behavior of \code{train}.
  If none is given a default is selected.} \item{metric}
  {a character string passed to \code{train}. a string that
  specifies what summary metric will be used to select the
  optimal model. By default, possible values are "RMSE" and
  "Rsquared" for regression and "Accuracy" and "Kappa" for
  classification. If custom performance metrics are used (via
  the \code{summaryFunction} argument in trainControl, the
  value of metric should match one of the arguments. If it
  does not, a warning is issued and the first metric given
  by the summaryFunction is used.} \item{cores}{An integer
  representing the number of cores to use on Windows. If not
  on windows, a warning is issued.} \item{...}{Additional
  arguments to be passed to \code{\link{train}}}
}
\value{
A character string with an error if unsuccessful.
The result of the \code{modAcc} call if successful:
\itemize{ \item{method - the \code{\link{train}}
method used to fit the model} \item{summaryTr - the
\code{\linkS4class{ROCit}} for the training data}
\item{summaryTe - the \code{\linkS4class{ROCit}} for the
test data} \item{time - the time reported for the model
to run, taken from the \code{\link{train}} object if
available} }
}
\description{
This function wraps the \code{train} function in the
\code{caret} package with model accuracy reports. It also
allows for errors in fitting models to be caught to make it
easier to use in a loop.
}
\note{
The values presented are for the optimal threshold as
computed by the \code{\link{roc}} function. For some model
types linear combos of predictors may be omitted.
