\title{Sample caret methods to maximize dissimilarity in the algorithm}
\usage{
dissimMethod(methods, k, distancemethod, n, what = c("tags", "matrix"))
}
\arguments{
  \item{methods}{a vector of character representing
  method names in caret} \item{k}{the number of clusters}
  \item{distancemethod}{the method used to calculate the
  dissimilarity} \item{n}{number methods to sample per
  cluster} \item{what}{what to return, either "tags" for the
  caretTags data or "matrix" for the dissimilarity matrix}
}
\value{
Returns either a dataframe or a matrix with the
dissimilarity values for the methods sampled and the names
of the methods.
}
\description{
Create a subset of caret methods in an effort to maximize
dissimilarity between them along the features identified in
the caretTags dataset
}
\examples{
require(EWStools)
data(caretTags)
dissimMethod(sample(caretTags$method, 30), k = 4, distancemethod = "maximum", n = 2, what = "tags")
}
