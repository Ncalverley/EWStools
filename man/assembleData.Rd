\title{Assemble train and test data for model building with EWStools}
\usage{
assembleData(data, class, p, predvars, classification = TRUE,
  keepNA = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{data}{a dataframe that the user would like to split
  into training and sample sets} \item{class}{character
  value of the name of the dependent variable} \item{p}
  {the proportion of data to be placed into a training
  set} \item{predvars}{a character vector of the names of
  predictor variables} \item{classification}{Is the training
  set for a classification problem or not? Default is TRUE.}
  \item{keepNA}{Should missing values be preserved in the
  data sets? Logical. Default is FALSE.} \item{...}{additional
  arguments to be passed to assembleData}
}
\value{
A list of lists with the following items:
\itemize{ \item{traindata - a list with a dataframe of the
predictor matrix called preds, and the class called class}
\item{testdata - a list with a dataframe of the predictor
matrix called preds, and the class called class} }
}
\description{
Assemble train and test data for model building with
EWStools
}
\details{
To return a 3-way split with a validation set, use the
\code{pvalid} argument.If classification is set to true the
"class" component of the list will be forced to a factor for
being fed into the train routine.
