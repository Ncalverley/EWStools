\title{Calculate a confidence interval for a vector}
\usage{
ci(x, scale)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{a numeric vector, can contain missing values, if
  so, they are ignored} \item{scale}{the factor to multiply
  the standard deviation by when creating the interval}
}
\value{
a numeric vector with three elements, the low end of the
confidence interval, the median, and the high end of the
confidence interval
}
\description{
Given a vector, this function produces a three number
summary consisting of the median, the median minus the
standard deviation (multiplied by a scaling factor), and the
median plus the standard deviation multiplied by a scaling
factor.
